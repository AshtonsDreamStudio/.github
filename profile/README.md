# Welcome to Ashton's Dream Studio

I am Ashton (The owner of this thing)

I am a young talented programmer from the UK

I want to start learning game development and decided to start that

I will be uploading all the source code of the games made to this github org

Please don't be too harsh on me as I am just learning game development and I am very green when it comes to it.

Also I have done some game development before but I want to start fresh and relearn it that should be easy for me as I am a fullstack developer and get a grasp on the basics of new languages and things of those sorts pretty easy.

Ill update this readme more soon.
